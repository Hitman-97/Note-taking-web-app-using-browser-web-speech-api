This Note-Taking Web App is built using React.js and the Web Speech API for transcription. The main components include `App.js`, which handles the app's overall state and logic for adding, editing, and deleting notes, and `RecordButton.js`, which uses the Web Speech API to transcribe spoken words into text and send it back to `App.js` for updating the note content. `NoteList.js` is responsible for displaying the list of notes with a search functionality to filter notes by title or content. Each note is rendered using the `NoteCard.js` component, which displays the note details and provides options for deleting or editing the note. The app leverages React state management to handle the dynamic updates to notes, while the Web Speech API enables real-time transcription of audio input. The app also includes basic CSS for styling and handles note data in the browser without a backend, though it can be extended with persistent storage and authentication in future iterations.
